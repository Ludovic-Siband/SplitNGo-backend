This module is the _Backend For Frontend_ (BFF) of the SplitNGo application, a travel management app for friends, developed in Java 21 with Spring Boot 3.4.3.

== ⚙️ Technologies

- Java 21
- Spring Boot 3.4.3
- Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`)
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Spring Devtools

== 🚀 Launch the project

=== 🔗 Connecting `bff` and `trip-api` via Shared Docker Network

To allow the `bff` service to communicate with the `trip-api` service across different repositories, we use a **shared external Docker network**.

This ensures proper service-to-service communication across containers, even when launched separately.

📦 1. Create the Shared Network

You only need to do this once on your machine:

```bash
docker network create splitngo-net
```

=== 🛠️ Development Mode (default)

The development mode uses `spring-boot-devtools` to enable hot reload.

[source,bash]
----
make dev
----

or directly:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose up
----

=== 🚢 Production Mode

[source,bash]
----
make prod
----

or:

[source,bash]
----
BUILD_MODE=prod docker compose up
----

== 🧪 Manual Compilation

=== Build the application (without tests)

[source,bash]
----
make build
----

=== Clean the project

[source,bash]
----
make clean
----

== ⏹️ Properly stop the application

To stop running containers:

[source,bash]
----
docker compose down
----

== 🧹 Maintenance

[WARNING]
=== ⚠️ Delete containers, volumes and images ⚠️
====
This command **removes the containers**, **volumes**, and **associated Docker resources**.

Use it **only if you want to reset everything**, for example after critical changes in volumes or a corrupted database.

It will also delete **persisted data** (if volumes are used).

[source,bash]
----
make nuke
----
====

=== Fully rebuild the Docker image

[source,bash]
----
make rebuild
----

== ⚙️ Spring Boot Configuration

The `application-dev.yml` file contains settings specific to development mode.

[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  devtools:
    restart:
      enabled: true
    livereload:
      enabled: true
  logging:
    level:
      root: DEBUG
